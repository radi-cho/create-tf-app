# create-tf-app
Set up a ML project in Tensorflow by running one command.

Inspired by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [create-ml-app](https://github.com/shreyashankar/create-ml-app). Some functionalities based on [Tensorflow-Project-Template](https://github.com/MrGemy95/Tensorflow-Project-Template).
