# create-tf-app
Set up and maintain ML projects in Tensorflow by running a single script.

Inspired by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [create-ml-app](https://github.com/shreyashankar/create-ml-app). Some functionalities are based on [Tensorflow-Project-Template](https://github.com/MrGemy95/Tensorflow-Project-Template).
